# all-things-advocacy
Hello! This repository contains content associated to developer advocacy events, talks, webinars, etc. that I've either given or been part of. You can find blog content referenced on my primary repository at [hseligson1](https://github.com/hseligson1/hseligson1).

I enjoy speaking about topics that I'm learning so that I can share it with others and use it as an opportunity to learn from others, too!
